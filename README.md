# Automated-AWS-EC2-Instance-Management-and-Notification-System-with-Lambda-and-Terraform


# this code sets up an AWS Lambda function that stops EC2 instances and sends a notification to an SNS topic, which is triggered periodically by a CloudWatch Events rule. This automation can be useful for managing and monitoring AWS resources. However, it's important to note that granting overly permissive IAM policies (as done in this example) is a security risk and should be avoided in a real-world scenario.
